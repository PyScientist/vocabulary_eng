The utilization of Normal (Gaussian) and Log-normal distributions within
 petrophysical analysis, coupled with the Random Forest modeling approach

In the pursuit of developing robust machine learning models for petrophysical analysis, meticulous attention must be paid to the distributional characteristics of the features considered for inclusion. Numerous petrophysical parameters, such as porosity, water saturation, caliper readings, neutron porosity, gamma ray readings, and bulk density of rocks, typically exhibit a Gaussian or normal distribution. Although these distributions may manifest multiple modes due to the heterogeneous representation of different rock classes in the data, they generally conform to a normal distribution pattern.
However, certain parameters, such as resistivity or permeability and their derivatives, are often characterized by a lognormal distribution of values. This distribution is often observed when dealing with data that spans several orders of magnitude, as is common in petrophysical measurements. Log-normal distributions are skewed to the right, with a long tail extending towards higher values. To effectively integrate such parameters into the model and obtain meaningful responses, it imperative to transform them into a normal distribution. While this normalization process is indeed essential in many cases, there are some scenarios, such as when dealing with sections of relatively low resistivities, where the requirement for normalization may be less critical, as evidenced by investigations into the performance of RandomForest regression models are provided in the paper below.
