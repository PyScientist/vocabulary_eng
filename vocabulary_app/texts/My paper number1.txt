Like any other applied science, petrophysics adopts the latest technologies in its development. And not so long time ago, AI getting to influence on science thoughts in petrophysics. This was facilitated by rapid enhancement of computing power and implementing new sophisticated ML algorithms which become capable to process fast big amount information and to find patterns within complex datasets.
 More than one hundred years petrophysical studies have been used for obtaining information about subsurface. It even hard to imagine how huge amount of information were accumulated. Considerable part of this information is geologic-petrophysical information from oil and gas wells. And now using of earlier accumulated data getting easier and easier. Of course, if it structured well.
 The emergence of programming languages such as Python and R and their development and appearing libraries for data science such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, Tensor Flow and Jupyter simplify the usage of AI in applied sciences and petrophysics is no exception off this.
 With usage of such simple and strength tools been taken from data science implementing of AI in petrophysics become easier and available not only for persons with strong computer science background or mathematicians.
 Here several applications of AI for petrophysics now available for general petrophysical public and some links for further reading if you want details. Hope it inspire and encourage you for your own study.
 I have rated these sources, by my own opinion, if you have any concerns please leave it in comment. My rating based on usefulness and availability papers for reading free of charge my appreciation of their authors from all over the world for such a great impact.
